Next we will pick objects.

###  Create a background map.


#### Exercise:  Inspect your background map.  

Zoom in and see what detail you can make out.  On a well-calibrated
Baxter, you should be able to see detail up to several millimeters.
Some examples from our lab appear below. 


### Update the observed map.

#### Exercise: Put several objects in the scene and update the
     observed map.  

Inspect the observed map, background map, and discrepancy view.  If
     the objects do not appear well-segmented in the discrepancy
     window, than there may be a problem with your calibration.
